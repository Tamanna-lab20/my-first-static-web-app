         <p>A static web page in azure refers to a simple web page or website consisting of static content like HTML, CSS, Javascipt, and image files that are served directly to users without servers side processing. These static pages are hosted on azure, typically through the Azure Static Web Apps service, which make it easy to deploy and manage such websites.</p>
